**Sonar Data Classification with Logistic Regression**
This project utilizes logistic regression to classify sonar signals as either rocks (R) or mines (M) based on various features. The dataset used in this project is available as sonar_data.csv.

_Introduction_
Sonar data classification is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to differentiate between objects (in this case, rocks and mines) based on sonar signals. Logistic regression is employed as a classification algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

_Project Structure_
README.md: The file you're currently reading, providing an overview of the project.
sonar_data.csv: Dataset containing sonar signal features and corresponding labels (R for rocks, M for mines).
sonar_classification.py: Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and inference.

_Dependencies_
numpy: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and tools.
Usage

_Clone the repository:_
git clone git@github.com:aman-singhsm01/Sonar_Data-Classification-with-Logistic_Regression.git

_Install the dependencies:_
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Results
After training the logistic regression model on the sonar data, we achieved the following results:

Training Data Accuracy: 83%
Test Data Accuracy: 76%
Based on the trained model, you can also make predictions for new sonar signals.
